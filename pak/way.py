"""Pure-data helpers shared by every hex way baker.

Constants and small helpers that depend only on hex-tile geometry and
the engine's ribi encoding — no rendering, no asset cross-section.
The asset-specific cross-section (ballast for rail, pavement for road,
…) lives in the asset's own scene file and is consumed by
`pak/way_topology.py` through the `CrossSection` interface.

The names here are deliberately one source of truth for both the
.dat-side index space (hex ribi codes per `way_writer.cc::hex_ribi_code`)
and the renderer-side geometry (corners, edges).
