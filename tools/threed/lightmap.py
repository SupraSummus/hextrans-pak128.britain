"""Lightmap encoding shared across hex pakset bakers.

A pakset *lightmap* is an RGBA cell whose RGB carries a uniform grey
Lambert ramp (`(g, g, g)`) and whose alpha is the covered-pixel mask.
The engine reads it via `descriptor/ground_desc.cc::create_textured_tile`,
which walks the RLE and per-pixel multiplies each 5-bit grey channel
into the matching climate-texture 5-bit channel divided by 16:

    rc = (red5(grey) * red5(texture)) / 16

So `grey5 == 16` is the identity multiplier (~1.0×), `grey5 == 0`
black-outs the pixel, `grey5 == 31` is the brightest peak.

This module owns the grey encoding.  Lambert math (face normal →
brightness) lives in `hex_synth`: ground bakers route through
`region_brightness` and bespoke-geometry bakers route through
`face_normal_brightness`, then both pass the resulting brightness
through `brightness_to_grey_rgb` here.  Keeping the encoding in one
place means the rounding convention and the reserved-palette dodge
stay in lockstep.
